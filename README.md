# jira-issues-to-gitlab
Move Jira issues to Gitlab

I forked it and made changes here because the original repository is archived.
See https://github.com/ulgens/jira-issues-to-gitlab/pull/4 for the discussion.

# How to use it
1. check out the repo
2. add a config.ini with your settings
3. maintain the users list mapping in the main.py
4. Attention: all issues will be deleted in the target gitlab project
5. run `python3 main.py`
